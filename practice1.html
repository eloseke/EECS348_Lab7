	I am a sophomore computer science student at the University of Kansas. <br>
	By the end of this academic year, I plan to complete my Upper-Level Eligibility, which includes courses covering calculus, discrete mathematics, programming, and the foundations of software engineering. <br> <br>
	Over the summer of 2023, I participated in a study abroad program in Wiesbaden, Germany. <br>
	I collaborated with students from Auburn University, students from South Africa, and students from Wiesbaden to develop a marketing campaign for Seibert Media, a local information technology company in Wiesbaden. <br>
	My team created social media ads for YouTube and Instagram and ads for bus stops and buses in Wiesbaden to market Seibert Media's free coding education classes and their website <a href="https://programmieren.de">programmieren.de</a>. <br>
	I analyzed the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that Seibert Media faces and estimated the production costs of our different marketing ideas. <br>
